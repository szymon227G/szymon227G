I'm a passionate artist and a game developer from Poland.
- Real name is Szymon, but you can just call me simon.
- My main focus is Game Design, 2D/3D Art & Animation, Programming and Story writing.
- 100% self-taught, jack of all trades, I specialize in getting stuff done fast on my own.
- My current focus right now is my Roblox game, Grace, which I'm the main developer for.
- Started young from an age of 10, I've learned a lot since then.
- Passion from faith, most of my works based on my passion towards religion.
- Borderline workoholic, work everyday, struggle to focus on things that aren't working on stuff (like school).
- Always trying to get out of my comfort zone, so I can learn through baptism by fire.
- Primary art style is Pixel-art.
- Trying to keep a good mood and spread it onto others :)

## The tools I work with are:
- Roblox Studio for game making projects and programming
- Blender for 3D modeling & animating
- LibreSprite/Paint.net for my 2D stuff
- Cavalry for vector art
- Visual Studio Code for the rare off chance I actually do a school coding assignment, or make a cool website
